# BRASS - Categorical variable association estimator

BRASS is a Bayesian method for estimating the degree of association between categorical variables. It is described in the paper 
"_Applying a new category association estimator to sentiment analysis on the Web_" ([Xavier et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05330)),
where it was applied to annotations of emotions identified on tweets in Portuguese.

## Installation

The Python packages required to run BRASS and all the analysis done in the paper are specified in `requirements.txt`. If you just want to use the 
[BRASS module](brass.py), you can run the following command:

      pip install -r min_requirements.txt

Then, just copy the `brass.py` file to a local folder where it can be found.


## Association between emotions

The analysis presented in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05330), that tests the method on synthetic data and applies it to emotions detected on tweets in portuguese, 
is available in the [./analysis](./analysis) folder. 

The data resulting from the complete annotation process of 4,613 tweets is available at [./data/processed](./data/processed). This is the data used in the analysis presented 
in the paper.
